Tools to parse data from Google Takeout Archives:

The hangout_parser.py file can be used to parse the Hangouts.json file that may be in a Google Takeout archive.
Merely run python hangout_parser.py in the same directory as the json file and it will create csv text files with the parsed conversations.
